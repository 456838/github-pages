Normally, this right exists where:</span></p><ul><li><ul><li><span>the data are no longer necessary; </span></li><li><span>you have withdrawn your consent to us using your data, and there is no other valid reason for us to continue; </span></li><li><span>the data has been processed unlawfully; </span></li><li><span>it is necessary for the data to be erased in order for us to comply with our obligations under law; or </span></li><li><span>you object to the processing and we are unable to demonstrate overriding legitimate grounds for our continued processing. </span></li></ul></li></ul><p><span> </span></p><p><span>We would only be entitled to refuse to comply with your request for erasure in limited circumstances and we will always tell you our reason for doing so.</span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span>When complying with a valid request for the erasure of data we will take all reasonably practicable steps to delete the relevant data. </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><strong><span>5) Right to restrict processing</span></strong><span> </span></p><p><span>You have the right to request that we restrict our processing of your personal data in certain circumstances, for example if you dispute the accuracy of the personal data that we hold about you or you object to our processing of your personal data for our legitimate interests. If we have shared your personal data with third parties, we will notify them about the restricted processing unless this is impossible or involves disproportionate effort. We will, of course, notify you before lifting any restriction on processing your personal data.</span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><strong><span>6) Right to rectification</span></strong><span> </span></p><p><span>You have the right to request that we rectify any inaccurate or incomplete personal data that we hold about you. If we have shared this personal data with third parties, we will notify them about the rectification unless this is impossible or involves disproportionate effort. You may also request details of the third parties that we have disclosed the inaccurate or incomplete personal data too. Where we think that it is reasonable for us not to comply with your request, we will explain our reasons for this decision.</span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><strong><span>7) Right of data portability</span></strong><span> </span></p><p><span>If you wish, you have the right to transfer your personal data between service providers. In effect, this means that you are able to transfer the details we hold on you to another third party. To allow you to do so, we will provide you with your data in a commonly used machine-readable format so that you can transfer the data. Alternatively, we may directly transfer the data for you. </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><strong><span>8) Right to complain</span></strong></p><p><span>You have the right to lodge a complaint with our regulator, who is the Information Commissioner&#39;s Office in the UK.

Security</span></h3><p><span>We will take all reasonable precautions necessary to protect your personal data from </span></p><ul><li><ul><li><span>loss, theft, misuse and interference;</span></li><li><span>unauthorized access, disclosure, use or modification.</span></li></ul></li></ul><p><span> </span></p><p><span>Such measures will vary depending on the sensitivity, amount, format, nature and storage of the information and will involve, as applicable, physical, organizational and electronic security measures. </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span>This includes, for example, the protection of passwords using industry standard encryption, measures to preserve system security and prevent unauthorized access and back-up systems to prevent accidental or malicious loss of data. We may use third party data storage providers to store personal data electronically. We take reasonable steps to ensure this information is held as securely as information stored on our own equipment.</span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span>Unfortunately, there is always risk involved in sending information through any channel over the internet. You send information over the internet entirely at your own risk. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted over the internet and we do not warrant the security of any information, including personal data, which you transmit to us over the internet.</span></p><h3 id='7-childrens-privacy'><span>7. Children’s Privacy</span></h3><p><span>This Service is not directed to children younger than thirteen (13) years of age. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to use our Services. If you are under 13, please do not use the Service and do not send any information about yourself to us.</span></p><h3 id='8-international-transfers-of-data'><span>8. International transfers of data</span></h3><p><span> The data that we collect from you will be transferred to, and stored at, destinations both within and outside the EEA. As mentioned above, we may disclose your personal data to our group companies and their service providers located in US and elsewhere, and to employees operating outside of the EEA who work for us or for one of our group companies or their respective service providers. </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span>We want to make sure that your personal data is stored and transferred in a way which is secure. We will therefore only transfer data outside of the EEA where it is compliant with data protection legislation and the means of transfer provides adequate safeguards in relation to your data. For example, this could be: </span></p><ul><li><ul><li><span>by way of an intra-group agreement between LiveSalton entities, incorporating the current standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission for the transfer of personal data by controllers in the EEA to controllers and processors in jurisdictions without adequate data protection laws; </span></li><li><span>by way of a data transfer agreement with a third party, incorporating the current standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission for the transfer of personal data by controllers in the EEA to controllers and processors in jurisdictions without adequate data protection laws; or </span></li><li><span>by transferring your data to an entity which has signed up to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework for the transfer of personal data from entities in the EU to entities in the United States of America or any equivalent agreement in respect of other jurisdictions; or </span></li><li><span>by transferring your data to a country where there has been a finding of adequacy by the European Commission in respect of that country&#39;s levels of data protection via its legislation; or </span></li><li><span>where it is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract between ourselves and a third party and the transfer is in your interests for the purposes of that contract (for example, if we need to transfer your data to a benefits provider based outside the EEA); or</span></li><li><span>where you have consented to the data transfer.</span></li></ul></li></ul><p><span> </span></p><p><span>Where we transfer your personal data outside the EEA and where the country or territory in question does not maintain adequate data protection standards, we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</span></p><h3 id='9-cookies'><span>9.
